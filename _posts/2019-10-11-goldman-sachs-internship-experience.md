# Greetings from ASCII!

This is the second post under the series of Internship/Placement Interviews and we have with us Ms. Shilpa Raju to share her Interview experience with Amazon and Goldman Sachs.

# Team ASCII: The Company at which you received your Internship/Placement.
# Shilpa: Amazon, Goldman Sachs

# Team ASCII: How should one prepare for the upcoming Placements/Internships?
# Shilpa:
A solid two months of a lot of coding and familiarization with common data structures and algorithms is required. Try to also be comfortable with writing code on a piece of paper, which is what you will have to do in interviews. Try to not make a lot of mistakes while writing the code, even silly mistakes. Be prepared to calculate time complexity for solutions you've written. Often times they ask what the time complexity of the brute Force method is, what the time complexity of your solution is, and ask if it can be improved further. Be really strong with the basics, even sorting and all. They aren't testing your ability to remember data structures and algorithms. They are trying to see if your basics are strong and if you can think in the right direction.

Also, write everything that you've done on your resume. Even if you think it might not be relevant to the particular job profile, it doesn't hurt for the interviewer to know that you are a well rounded person.

# Team ASCII: What transpired during the multiple rounds of selections? (Please describe the kind of questions in your technical round and HR interviews, the difficulty levels, time limits and provide a general walk-through of the process)
# Shilpa:
The technical rounds have pretty standard questions. If you're preparing properly from Hackerrank/Codechef/InterviewBit there's a good chance you'd know the question, or at least a similar one. Time limit isn't an issue. Keep talking throughout the time you're solving the problem. Let them know your train of thought. They care more about that than about the answer. That way, even if you get stuck they will help you out.

In the HR round, they asked me a few puzzles and what I would do in certain scenarios.


# All the best for your preparation and we hope to see you on the ASCII page!

# Best regards,
# Team ASCII
